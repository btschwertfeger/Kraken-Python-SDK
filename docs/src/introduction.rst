There is no guarantee that this software will work flawlessly at this or later times. Of course, no responsibility is taken for possible profits or losses. This software probably has some errors in it, so use it at your own risk. Also no one should be motivated or tempted to invest assets in speculative forms of investment. By using this software you release the author(s) from any liability regarding the use of this software.


This documentation is based on the following documentations and is used to describe methods, functions and classes of the python-kraken-sdk.

- Gladly open an issue on github on make if something is incorrect or missing (`python-kraken-sdk/issues`_)
- The ouput in the examples may differ, as these are really only intended as examples and the full output would only overload this.
- If a certain endpoint is not reachable, the function :func:`kraken.base_api.KrakenBaseSpotAPI._request` or :func:`kraken.base_api.KrakenBaseFuturesAPI._request`, which is also available in all derived classes, can be used to reach an endpoint with the appropriate parameters. Here private content can also be accessed, provided that either the base class or
one of the clients has been initialized with valid credentials.

**ONLY tagged releases are availabe at PyPI**. The content of the master branch may not match with the content of the latest release. So please have a look at the release specific READMEs and changelogs.

.. _section-troubleshooting:

üö® Troubleshooting
------------------
- Check if you downloaded and installed the **latest version** of the python-kraken-sdk.
- Check the **permissions of your API keys** and the required permissions on the respective endpoints.
- If you get some cloudflare or **rate limit errors**, please check your Kraken Tier level and maybe apply for a higher rank if required.
- **Use different API keys for different algorithms**, because the nonce calculation is based on timestamps and a sent nonce must always be the highest nonce ever sent of that API key. Having multiple algorithms using the same keys will result in invalid nonce errors.
- Feel free to open an issue at `python-kraken-sdk/issues`_.
